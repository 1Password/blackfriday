This is a test suite for Blackfriday's CommonMark compatibility. Currently it is
placed in a subpackage to avoid breaking the main test suite. When full
compatibility is reached, it should get moved to the main test suite.

The `testdata/commonmark-tests-dump.json` was generated by running the following
commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:commonmark/CommonMark.git
$ cd CommonMark
$ python3 test/spec_tests.py --dump-tests > commonmark-tests-dump.json
```

Run the tests with `go run commonmark_testsuite.go`. Notice that Blackfriday is
imported as `"github.com/russross/blackfriday.v2"` here. This means that you have
to have Blackfriday v2 branch checked out as `blackfriday.v2` in you `$GOPATH`:

```
$ go get -u "github.com/russross/blackfriday"
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/russross/blackfriday
$ git checkout v2
$ cd ..
$ mv blackfriday blackfriday.v2
```
